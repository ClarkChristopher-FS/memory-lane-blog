# Memory Lane Blog

A blog about web development and learning. Built with Next.js for Assignment 1.9.

## What This Is

A static blog site that demonstrates:

- Creating blog posts as JavaScript objects
- Building a home page that lists all posts
- Creating individual post pages
- Navigation between pages
- Custom styling and JavaScript interactions

## Blog Posts

1. Learning MongoDB and Express
2. Postman for API Testing
3. Deploying Static Sites to GitHub Pages

## Running Locally

To run on your computer:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Building for Production

To build for deployment:

```
npm run build
```

This creates static HTML files. I moved them to the root so GitHub Pages can serve them.

## Deployment

Deployed to GitHub Pages using the root folder. The static files are in the root directory.
